v0.4.0-alpha
2025.11.14
- Added new 'limit' section that allows applying constraints to various components

- Added new input field type - 'Checkbox' and corresponding styles
- Added events to 'Card' component that can be enabled by calling 'allowCustomEvents' method
- Added new component - 'Modal' - modal window with default parameters: left = '20vw', top = '20vh', width = '60vw', height = '60vh', fadeIn = 300, fadeOut = 300, elementType = 'div', autoRebuild = true, blur = 0, autoHeight = false, where blur - background blur when modal is opened
- Added 'noAnimation' mode for 'Tabs' component, which allows completely disabling rendering of components on inactive tabs, significantly improving performance

- Several style fixes
`,
    '0.3.1': `
v0.3.1-alpha

    '0.3.0': `
v0.3.0-alpha
2025.09.29
- Renamed 'Event' factory to 'Handler'
- Added new 'Event' component — a container for subscribed functions that can call them all via 'emit()', which also accepts parameters. Subscription via 'sub(fn)', unsubscription via 'unsub(fn)'
- Removed 'Applicable' as it was unnecessary; file structure updated
- 'Preferences' component can now parse a list produced by the constructor into an object. Method 'parse()' accepts a list of keys
- Added 'swap()' method to 'Component' class to swap components in the make.js component tree
- Completely rewritten 'Query' component; functionality preserved but codebase cleaned up. Separate entities now store body, headers, query string and route
- Reworked 'Notice' component; it now supports "weak" notifications (default weak=false) that hide when a new notice enters the queue. All settings moved to a 'Preferences' instance. New syntax requires passing values as a list, e.g. 'make.Notice([500, 500, 500, "this-is-unique-id", {weak: true}], ...someStuff)'
- Some components now have their own 'Event' instances
- Added a testing module for components
- Cleaned up comments
- Fixed several minor bugs
`,
    '0.2.2': `
v0.2.2-dev
2025.09.25
- Rewrote 'Event' factory: you can now pass a factory that returns multiple handlers and their types, enabling more complex interactions
- Added 'SideSeparator' — an analog of Separator
- Restored 'Tabs' component functionality: you can now correctly use components as tab buttons and as tab content
- Added 'splitLastN' function, which allows signatures like '(...args, afterArgs)'
- Rewrote 'Query' component: query string construction now happens in the where method, similar to with
- Minor style tweaks
`,
    '0.2.1': `
v0.2.1-dev

`,
    '0.2.0': `
v0.2.0-dev
2025.09.15
- Added 'Annotation(time, ...components)' component, which appears in time milliseconds after hovering over the component to which it is attached
`,
    '0.1.2': `
v0.1.2-dev
2025.09.11
- Changed 'Query' component operation logic: now it restores the state to the last checkpoint received via view() using get, post, put, patch, delete
- Improved meta.js file!
`,
    '0.1.0': `
v0.1.0-dev
2025.09.09

- Added 'Pre' component that wraps the <pre> tag

`,
    '0.0.6': `
v0.0.6-dev

- Reworked 'Notice': separated animations into open, idle, and close states
- Added 'closeCurrentNotice()' function, which finds the closest 'Notice' and closes it
- Added 'UniqueNotice(id, tIn, tIdle, tOut, ...dec)' component, which does not allow adding multiple notices with the same id to the handler
- Separated changelog, version, and greetings from the 'make.js' file
